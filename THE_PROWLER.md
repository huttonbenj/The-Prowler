# 1. The Opportunity

## College Sports Just Changed Forever

For decades, college athletes couldn't make a dime from their own name. A quarterback with half a million Instagram followers couldn't accept $200 from a local restaurant to post about them. If they did, the NCAA would strip their eligibility — they couldn't play.

That era is over.

**July 2021** — The NCAA changed the rules. Athletes can now profit from their **NIL** — their **N**ame, **I**mage, and **L**ikeness. Endorsement deals, social media sponsorships, paid appearances, merchandise — all fair game. A brand-new market was born overnight.

**June 2025** — A massive lawsuit called **House v. NCAA** was settled. This reshaped the entire landscape. Schools can now directly share up to **~$20 million per year** of their revenue with athletes. The old amateur model is officially dead.

**July 2025** — The **College Sports Commission (CSC)** launched — a new independent body with the authority to enforce NIL rules and declare athletes ineligible. They created an online reporting system called **NIL Go** where athletes must disclose their deals.

**The critical rule:** Any deal worth **$600 or more** must be reported through NIL Go within **5 business days.** Miss the deadline and the athlete risks losing their eligibility to play.

These are 18-22 year olds juggling school, practice, games — and now they're suddenly running what amounts to a small business. They're forgetting to file. They're losing eligibility over paperwork.

> **The NIL market is $2.75 billion as of 2025.** The average deal is about $1,500 — not million-dollar mega-contracts, but thousands of everyday deals between local businesses and athletes. And every single one that crosses $600 triggers mandatory reporting.

---

## Nobody Has Solved This Yet

A handful of platforms exist. I researched every major one. Here's what each does and what each one misses:

| Platform | What They Do | What They Don't Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Opendorse** | The biggest NIL deal platform. Helps athletes find brand partnerships, manage contracts, and get paid. | No recruiting tools. A coach can't go on Opendorse and search for a player to recruit. It only helps athletes who already have deals lined up. |
| **INFLCR** (owned by Teamworks) | A brand management tool for athletic departments. Schools pay for it to manage their current athletes' media presence. | The school controls the athlete's profile — the athlete doesn't own it. No marketplace. No recruiting. |
| **MOGL** | An AI-powered platform that automatically matches athletes with brands for campaigns. | No tools for coaches or scouts. You can't search by stats, position, or location. Only handles brand-to-athlete matching. |
| **Stack Athlete** (formerly CaptainU) | A recruiting profile builder. Athletes create a page with stats and film, then share a link with coaches. | No NIL deals, no marketplace, no AI, no compliance automation. It's a website builder. |
| **SportsRecruits** | A communication tool — athletes and coaches can message each other. | Old technology. No video analysis, no AI search, no NIL anything. |

```mermaid

    Stack Athlete: [0.7, 0.15]
    SportsRecruits: [0.6, 0.1]
    The Prowler: [0.85, 0.9]
```

**The gap is clear.** No platform combines coach-facing recruiting and discovery with an athlete-facing NIL marketplace and automated compliance. An athlete today would need accounts on 4-5 different services to cover everything.

**The Prowler fills the entire gap in one product.**

## Three Products in One Platform

```mermaid

        A["🏈 Recruiting & Discovery<br/>Athletes build profiles. Coaches find talent."]
        B["💰 NIL Marketplace<br/>Brands offer deals. Athletes get paid."]

## What Athletes Experience

```mermaid

    E --> F["Brands Offer<br/>You Deals"]
    F --> G["Get Paid 💰<br/>Stay Eligible ✅"]

    style G fill:#1b4332,color:#fff
```

1. Download the app, create a profile — name, school, sport, position, stats, GPA, location
2. Upload game film (full games or individual clips)
3. Our AI watches the film and automatically identifies the best plays, cutting them into a highlight reel — no editing, no cost
4. Coaches discover you through search or through an AI assistant where they describe what they're looking for in plain language
5. Brands browse your profile and create sponsorship deals
6. When a deal happens, the platform holds the money safely until you complete the work, auto-files all compliance paperwork, and deposits your payment

**The athlete never thinks about CSC disclosures, tax forms, or deadlines. The platform handles it all.**

---

## What Coaches and Scouts Experience

```mermaid

    B --> C["Or Ask the AI Assistant:<br/>'Find me a left-handed<br/>pitcher in the Southeast<br/>with ERA under 3.0'"]
    C --> D["Browse Profiles<br/>Watch Film<br/>Compare Stats"]
    D --> E["Save to<br/>Recruit Lists"]
    E --> F["Contact<br/>Athletes"]
```

Coaches and scouts access the platform through a web portal — browser-based, no app needed. They get:

- **Filtered search** — sport, position, location, graduation year, physical stats, performance stats
- **AI-powered scouting assistant** — type a question in plain English and get ranked results with evidence
- **Film review** — watch highlight reels and full game film directly on the platform
- **Recruit lists** — save athletes to custom lists, track prospects, and take notes
- **Direct contact** — reach out to athletes through the platform

Coaches pay a **monthly subscription** to access these tools.

## What Brands and Sponsors Experience

```mermaid

    E --> F["Athlete Completes<br/>the Work"]
    F --> G["Payment Released<br/>to Athlete"]

    style G fill:#1b4332,color:#fff
```

Brands create an account and verify their identity (required by law before any financial transactions). They browse athletes, create deals with specific deliverables and dollar amounts, and the platform handles the rest.

## The Compliance Engine — Our Biggest Advantage

This is what separates The Prowler from everything else on the market. **No other platform automates the compliance process end-to-end.**

Athletes are losing eligibility right now because they forgot to file paperwork within 5 days. We make that impossible.

### Every Compliance Requirement — Handled Automatically

| What's Required | Who Requires It | How The Prowler Handles It |
|---|---|---|
| Report deals ≥$600 within 5 business days | College Sports Commission (CSC) | Auto-generates the disclosure and submits it to the NIL Go portal |
| Verify everyone's identity before money moves | Federal and state law | Automatic ID + selfie check during signup (through a service called Persona) |
| Collect tax ID forms (W-9) before any payment | IRS | Required during account setup, stored with encryption |
| Issue 1099 tax forms for payments over $600/year | IRS | Generated automatically at the end of each tax year |
| Hold money until work is complete (escrow) | Platform policy — protects both sides | Funds held in a secure holding account through Stripe, our payment processor |

**This is our competitive advantage.** It's hard to build, it's legally complex, and once athletes depend on it, they won't leave. Every other platform makes athletes handle their own compliance — we're the only ones who make it automatic.

One backend system powers both the mobile app and the web portal. One database, one set of rules, one source of truth. If an athlete updates their stats on their phone at 2am, a coach sees it on their laptop at 8am. Nothing is ever out of sync.

### Why Each Technology Was Chosen

| Component | What It Does | Why I Chose It |
|---|---|---|
| **FastAPI (Python)** — the backend | The "brain" — handles every request, runs every rule, talks to every service | High performance, handles thousands of requests per second. Python has the best AI libraries — critical for our smart search and video analysis |
| **Flutter** — the mobile app | The app athletes and parents use on their phones | Write it once, runs on both iPhone and Android. Saves 30-40% on development cost vs. building two separate apps. Compiles to fast native code. |
| **Next.js (React)** — the web portal | The browser-based interface coaches, scouts, and brands use | The most popular web framework in the world. Fast loading, search-engine friendly (so athlete profiles show up in Google), largest talent pool for future hiring |
| **PostgreSQL** — the database | Stores all platform data — profiles, stats, deals, contracts, media references | The most trusted database in the industry. Used by Instagram, Spotify, US government. Free to use. With an add-on called pgvector, it can do AI-powered searches. |
| **Redis** — the cache | Stores frequently-accessed data for instant retrieval | Makes the app feel fast. When 1,000 coaches hit the search page at the same time, Redis keeps things snappy. |
| **Stripe Connect** — payments | Collects money from brands, holds it safely, pays it out to athletes | The same payment processor used by Amazon, Shopify, and Lyft. Their "Connect" product is purpose-built for marketplaces exactly like ours. |
| **Persona** — identity verification | Checks government IDs and does selfie matching to verify someone is real | Required by law before any financial transactions. Used by major financial platforms. |
| **Twelve Labs** — video AI | Watches game film and understands what's happening | Can identify touchdowns, interceptions, tackles, assists — then auto-cut highlight clips with no human editor. |

    end

    VID --> STORE --> ANALYZE --> TAG --> CLIP --> REEL
    ANALYZE --> INDEX --> SEARCH
```

### How the Smart Search Works

```mermaid

    PARSE --> MEANING["Search AI index<br/>for related matches:<br/>Similar scouting<br/>reports & film tags"]
    FILTER --> MERGE["Combine & Rank<br/>All Results"]
    MEANING --> MERGE
    MERGE --> RESULTS["📋 Ranked Athletes<br/>with Stats, Film &<br/>Evidence"]
```

> **A note on data:** AI features are only as good as the data behind them. In the early phases, data comes from athletes entering their own stats and uploading their own film. As we grow, we build partnerships with data providers like MaxPreps and Hudl to bring in verified stats. The AI gets smarter as the data grows.

## Security

| Layer | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Account security** | Two-step login for all financial transactions |
| **Identity verification** | Government ID + live selfie check for all marketplace participants |
| **Data encryption** | All data encrypted when stored (AES-256) and when transmitted (TLS 1.3) |
| **Payment security** | PCI-DSS compliant through Stripe — no credit card data ever touches our servers |
| **Audit trail** | Every deal, payment, disclosure, and status change permanently logged |
| **Access control** | 6 permission levels — each user type sees only what they should |
| **Secrets management** | All passwords, API keys, and credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager — never in code |

## Infrastructure

```

Everything runs on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** — the same infrastructure behind Netflix, Airbnb, and most of the tech industry. The platform auto-scales: more servers spin up when traffic increases, scale back when it's quiet. We only pay for what we use.

# 5. The Deal

---

## How Partnerships Like This Normally Work

When a developer believes in a project enough to reduce or waive their upfront rate, they trade cash for ownership. This is standard in the startup world — it's how most tech companies get built.

**The principle is simple: the less cash you pay upfront, the more ownership and revenue you share with the person building it.**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Full["💵 Full Cash"]
        A["Pay $125/hr<br/>Developer gets no equity<br/>No revenue share<br/>Clean transaction"]
    end

    subgraph Reduced["🤝 Reduced Cash"]
        B["Pay $50–75/hr<br/>Developer gets 15–30% equity<br/>3–5% revenue share<br/>Shared risk"]
    end

    subgraph Zero["📈 Zero Cash"]
        C["$0 upfront<br/>Developer gets 40–50% equity<br/>8–15% revenue share<br/>Developer is a co-founder"]
    end

    Full -->|"More cash = less equity"| Reduced
    Reduced -->|"Less cash = more equity"| Zero
```

### What Zero-Cash Deals Look Like Across the Industry

When someone asks a developer to build a $252,500 product for no upfront payment, they're asking that person to work for free for 20 months. The developer takes on 100% of the financial risk — their only compensation comes from the product's success.

The standard terms for that level of risk:

| Term | Industry Standard |
|---|---|
| Equity | 40–50% |
| Revenue share | 8–15% of gross revenue, paid monthly, indefinitely |
| Title | Co-Founder / CTO |
| Vesting | Earned over 3–4 years |

```mermaid
pie title Who Carries the Financial Risk When Cash Is $0
    "Developer — 2,020 hours of unpaid work ($252,500 value)" : 100
    "Founder — $0" : 0
```

These aren't inflated numbers — this is how the industry works. The equity and revenue share exist to offset the risk of working for free.

## What I'm Proposing

I've already spent a week of my own time — unpaid — researching this market, designing the architecture, analyzing every competitor, and building out this entire strategy document. I wouldn't do that if I didn't believe in this.

Here's my offer:

| Term | My Proposal | Industry Standard |
|---|---|---|
| **Upfront cash** | **$0** | $0 |
| **Equity** | **35%** | 40–50% |
| **Revenue share** | **8%** of gross revenue, monthly, indefinitely | 8–15% |
| **Vesting** | 36 months with 6-month cliff | 36–48 months |
| **Title** | CTO / Co-Founder | CTO / Co-Founder |
| **What I build** | Complete platform — all 4 phases | — |
| **Maintenance** | 12 months included after Phase 4 | — |
| **Infrastructure costs** | Paid by The Prowler LLC | — |
| **Code ownership** | All IP owned by The Prowler LLC | — |
| **If I leave** | Vested equity and revenue share stay with me. All code stays with the company. | — |

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Offer["What I'm Asking For"]
        direction TB
        A["💵 $0 upfront from you"]
        B["📈 35% equity — below the 40-50% standard"]
        C["💰 8% revenue share — bottom of the 8-15% range"]
        D["🔧 CTO / Co-Founder"]
        E["📋 Full platform build over 20 months"]
    end

### Your Revenue at Scale

You keep the large majority of everything the platform earns. My 8% comes off the top — everything else is yours.

| Monthly Platform Revenue | Your Share (92%) | My 8% |
|---|---|---|
| $10,000/mo (early days) | $9,200 | $800 |
| $50,000/mo (growing) | $46,000 | $4,000 |
| $80,000/mo (Year 2 target) | $73,600 | $6,400 |
| $200,000/mo (at scale) | $184,000 | $16,000 |

### What Each of Us Brings

| | You (Preston) | Me (Ben) |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | CEO / Founder | CTO / Co-Founder |
| **What you bring** | Vision, sports industry expertise, regulatory knowledge, business development, partnerships, sales, relationships with athletes and schools | Architecture, engineering, AI/ML, mobile + web development, infrastructure, security, payment + compliance integrations |
| **Ownership** | 65% | 35% |
| **Revenue** | 92% of gross | 8% of gross |
| **Focus** | Business, growth, partnerships | Building, maintaining, and scaling the platform |

## What Happens Next

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["We Agree on Terms"] --> B["Form The Prowler LLC"]
    B --> C["I Start Phase 1"]
    C --> D["5 Months Later:<br/>Working Product"]
    D --> E["Athletes On It.<br/>Coaches Using It."]
    E --> F["Core Product Proven."]
    F --> G["Then We Scale."]

    style G fill:#1b4332,color:#fff
```

Phase 1 delivers a working product where athletes create profiles with stats and game film, and coaches search for and discover them. That's the proof of concept — can we build something coaches actually want to use?

Everything after Phase 1 builds on the same foundation. No throwaway work. Every feature, every database table, every security system carries forward.

I'm ready to start when you are.
