# How to Present The Prowler to Preston

**This is your playbook. Read it before the meeting. Don't read from it during.**

---

## The Meeting Structure

You have three acts. Each one builds on the last. Don't rush through them.

---

## Act 1: The Problem (5 minutes)

Start here. Don't open with tech. Open with pain.

**What to say:**

> "Preston, I spent the last week tearing apart every platform in this space — Opendorse, MOGL, INFLCR, Stack Athlete, SportsRecruits, all of them. Every single one solves one piece of the puzzle. Opendorse handles NIL deals but has zero recruiting tools. Stack Athlete does recruiting profiles but has no marketplace, no AI, nothing. MOGL does AI matching but a coach can't search by stats or film.
>
> Nobody has put all of it under one roof. And now with the House settlement and the College Sports Commission launching last July — with $600 deals having to be reported within 5 days or athletes lose eligibility — compliance isn't optional anymore. It's the product.
>
> That's the gap we fill."

**Key numbers to drop naturally:**
- NIL is a $2.75 billion market
- House v. NCAA settled June 2025 — schools can share ~$20M/year with athletes
- CSC has already started investigating unreported deals
- Average NIL deal is ~$1,500, not all massive contracts

## Act 2: The Solution (10 minutes)

Now you open the strategy doc. Walk him through visually. Don't read the doc to him — use the diagrams as anchors.

**What to say as you scroll through:**

> "Here's what I built out. One backend brain that serves both a mobile app for athletes and a web portal for coaches. One database, one API, everything in sync.
>
> Let me walk you through what each user actually does..."

**Point to the athlete journey diagram:**

> "Athlete signs up on their phone, builds their profile, uploads game film. The AI auto-cuts their highlights — no editing, no cost to them. Coaches find them through search or through the AI co-pilot where they can just type what they're looking for in plain English.
>
> When a brand wants to sponsor them, the deal flows through the platform. We hold the money in escrow, verify the athlete delivers, and then release payment. If the deal is over $600, we automatically report it to the NCAA's NIL Go portal so the athlete's eligibility is never at risk."

**Point to the compliance flowchart:**

> "This right here is the moat. No one else automates this. Athletes are losing eligibility right now because they forgot to file paperwork. We make that impossible."

---

## Act 3: The Business (10 minutes)

This is where you show the weight of the work AND your proposed deal.

**What to say:**

> "Let me be honest with you about what this takes to build. I itemized every feature, every hour. It's 2,020 hours of development across four phases. At market rate — $125 an hour, which is the median for this skill set — that's $252,500.
>
> Phase 1 alone is 524 hours and $65,500. That's the foundation — profiles, search, auth, mobile app, coach portal, everything deployed.
>
> Infrastructure is cheap. Phase 1 runs at $160 a month. The expensive stuff — video AI, payment processing — doesn't kick in until Phase 2 and 3.
>
> Now — I know you're not writing a $252K check. Neither would I. So here's what I want to propose."

---

## The Deal Pitch

This is the most important part. You're not discounting your work. You're restructuring how you get paid.

**What to say:**

> "I believe in this project enough to put my own money on the line by investing my time. Here's what I'm proposing..."

### Option A: The "Technical Co-Founder" Model (Recommended)

> "Instead of $125 an hour, I'll work at $50 an hour — cost of living, keeps the lights on. That drops Phase 1 from $65,500 down to $26,200. The full build goes from $252K down to about $101K.
>
> In exchange, I take a 30% equity stake in The Prowler. I'm not an employee. I'm a partner. I build it, I maintain it, I scale it. If this works and we're doing $80K a month in revenue, that equity is worth a hell of a lot more than the hourly rate I'm discounting.
>
> I also want a 5% revenue share on all platform transaction fees in perpetuity. So when the marketplace goes live and we're taking 10% on every NIL deal, I get 5% of that 10% — half a point on every deal, forever. That's my passive income."

Here's how the math works to show him:

| | Full Rate | Discounted Rate | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hourly rate** | $125/hr | $50/hr | -$75/hr |
| **Phase 1** | $65,500 | $26,200 | You save $39,300 |
| **Phase 2** | $64,500 | $25,800 | You save $38,700 |
| **Phase 3** | $82,500 | $33,000 | You save $49,500 |
| **Phase 4** | $40,000 | $16,000 | You save $24,000 |
| **Total** | **$252,500** | **$101,000** | **Preston saves $151,500** |

What you get back:
| Your Compensation | Details |
|---|---|
| **Cash (reduced rate)** | $101,000 over ~20 months (~$5,050/mo) |
| **30% equity** | Ownership stake. Grows with the company. |
| **5% of platform revenue** | Passive income. Every NIL deal, every subscription. Forever. |

**Revenue share math at scale:**

| Monthly Platform Revenue | Your 5% Share |
|---|---|
| $10,000/mo (early Phase 3) | $500/mo |
| $50,000/mo (growing) | $2,500/mo |
| $80,000/mo (target Year 2) | $4,000/mo |
| $200,000/mo (scale) | $10,000/mo |

---

### Option B: The "Deferred Comp" Model (if he pushes back on equity %)

> "If 30% equity feels like too much, here's another structure. I work at $75 an hour — that's 40% below market. Total build drops to $151,500. The $101K difference between that and market rate gets logged as deferred compensation. When revenue hits, I get paid back from profits before any distributions. Plus I still want 15-20% equity and a 3% revenue share."

| | Full Rate | Discounted Rate |
|---|---|---|
| **Hourly rate** | $125/hr | $75/hr |
| **Total** | $252,500 | $151,500 |
| **Deferred comp** | — | $101,000 (paid from profits) |
| **Equity** | — | 15-20% |
| **Revenue share** | — | 3% |

---

### Option C: The "Phase-by-Phase" Model (if he needs to start small)

> "Let's not commit to the whole thing. Pay me for Phase 1 at full rate — $65,500. We prove the core product works. If it does, we negotiate the long-term deal for Phases 2-4 with equity and revenue sharing. No risk for either of us."

---

## What to Push Back On

Preston will negotiate. Here's what to expect and how to handle it:

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**
> "I already cut my rate by 60%. The $50/hr rate is below what junior developers charge. The equity and revenue share is how I make that work — I'm betting on the product alongside you."

**"30% equity is too much for a developer."**
> "I'm not just a developer. I'm designing the architecture, building the infrastructure, writing every line of code, handling deployment, and maintaining a platform that processes money and legal contracts. If you hired a CTO and a dev team to do this, you'd be paying $300K-$500K a year in salaries. I'm one person doing all of it for a share of the upside."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
> "Then I've worked thousands of hours at $50 an hour and you've paid under market for a fully built platform. I'm the one taking the bigger risk. My equity is worth zero if this doesn't generate revenue."

**"Can't you just do it for equity only?"**
> "No. I have bills. The reduced rate keeps me focused on this full-time without taking other projects. If I'm doing this at zero cash, I'm splitting my time with paying clients and this project takes three years instead of twenty months."

**"I want to own all the IP."**
> "IP stays with The Prowler, LLC — the company we both own. My equity represents my ownership stake in that IP. If I leave, the code stays. Standard technical co-founder terms."

---

## How to Close

> "Preston, here's the bottom line. You've got the vision, the sports background, the regulatory knowledge. I've got the engineering. Together we fill every gap.
>
> The full build at market rate is a quarter million dollars. I'm offering to do it for $101K cash plus equity and a revenue share, because I think this is real and I want to be part of it long-term.
>
> Phase 1 is $26,200 and five months. That gets us a working product with athletes on it and coaches using it. We prove it works, we keep building. What do you think?"
